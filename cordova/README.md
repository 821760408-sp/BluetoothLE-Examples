# BLE Central for Cordova Examples

These examples use [Sandeep Mistry's Arduino BLE Peripheral library](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-BLEPeripheral) to create peripheral with custom services and characteristics. 

These examples can be used with nRF8001 and nRF51822 chips - see Sandeepâ€™s repo for list of compatible hardware.
